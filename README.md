# Numerical Methods
### A collection of various analysis of data in Python.
### Approximations - program predicting a position of a drone based on some of its localisations. Using polynomial and trigonometric approximation as well as measuring their errors.
### MACD&SIGNALonWIG20 - program plotting MAC and SIGNAL indicators used for predicting trends on the stock market. Using moving average, based on historical WIG20 data.
### NumericalIntegrations - calculating the integral of a probability density function using 4 different methods, as well as their errors and execution times:
- Midpoint method,
- Trapezoidal method,
- Simpson method,
- Monte Carlo method.
### RootFindingAlgorithms - comparison of methods vs their iterations. Comparison is done for bisect and secant root finding algorithms using the Kirchoff's rule formula to find its roots.
### All programs use:
- matplotlib library for plotting,
- scipy.io library to read MatLab files.
